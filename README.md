# Superstore Dataset Analysis with MySQL
 In this project, I analyzed the Superstore dataset using MySQL to uncover key business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. The dataset contains transactional data, including order details, customer demographics, product categories, sales, profit, and shipping details.

As a data analyst, my goal is to leverage SQL queries to:

1. Examine sales trends and profitability across different products and regions.
2. Identify top-performing customers and best-selling products.
3. Analyze the impact of discounts on profitability.
4. Assess shipping performance and its effect on customer satisfaction.
   
By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing key trends, this project provides data-driven recommendations to optimize 
  business decisions and improve operational efficiency
